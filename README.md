# MobileApp

This mini-project served as a way for me to practice using jQuery plugins to create an interactive mobile web application.

This mobile app is for college students seeking quick and easy recipes they can make in their dorm room. It provides information about recipes including cooking time and difficulty level. There is also a page to send feedback about the application.
